# DESCRIPTION
Why reinvent the wheel? This app lets you generate prefilled README.md documents. Just generate a new README, customize for your project, et voilà! Your README is ready to roll.

# USER STORY
*AS A* boot camp student whose brain has fallen into a sinkhole, *I WANT TO* automate creation of my README documents *SO I CAN* save time and avoid a catastrophic yet glorious mental collapse.
	
# INSTALLATION
This app is installed by opening Terminal and typing _node index.js_. You'll then be asked to populate the form by answering a series of questions. When you're finished, a new README.md file will appear in the sidebar of your text editor.
	
# USAGE
Open your new README document and save it with your project files. As your project evolves, you can further customize the README by adding features, credits, and so on.
	
# FEATURES
This README generator has a few swell features: 
* Badges
  - GitHub "Stars" and "Forks" badges
  - A GitHub repo badge
  - An MIT license badge
* Space to describe the user story
* Space to list features and technical specs
* Space to discuss lessons learned while building the app

# TECHNICAL SPECS
In building this app, I used node JS, npm inquirer, JSON package files, and a badges generator. The app runs on the command line and generates Markdown files.
	
# TESTS
I tested the app in VS code and used the console to check for errors. 
	
# LESSONS LEARNED 
* *Time management.* Even a seemingly easy project takes much longer than you think it will.
* *Creativity.* With each technology we're exposed to in boot camp, we can get as fancy as we like—or have time for. There's always another cool feature you'd like to add if you had the time to keep working on the project. It's like making rounds in med school. We learn just enough to learn what the technology is for and whether we like using it. Then it's time to move on to the next app or language. 
* *Technology*: 
  - Built a simple app with a command line interface
  - Worked in a runtime environment 
  - Learned about task automation

# CONTRIBUTIONS
This was an individual project, but I'd like to thank our new TA, Christian Pinto, who hopped online to help me on a Sunday afternoon.
